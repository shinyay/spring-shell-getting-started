# Spring Shell Getting Started

The Spring Shell project provides an interactive shell that allows you to plugin your own custom commands using a Spring based programming model.

- [Spring Shell](https://projects.spring.io/spring-shell)

## Description
### Dependency
```
dependencies {
	implementation("org.springframework.shell:spring-shell-starter:2.0.1.RELEASE")
}
```

### Spring Shell
Users of the Spring Shell project can easily build a full featured shell application by depending on the Spring Shell jars and adding their own commands (which come as methods on spring beans). 

#### `@ShellComponent`
a variation of @Component that is used to restrict the set of classes that are scanned for candidate commands
